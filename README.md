# Odoo Email Link

**Your Odoo CRM, supercharged with AI — in a single HTML file.**

OEL is a Progressive Web App that handles two things your CRM can't do alone: drafting smart follow-up emails from overdue activities, and capturing inbound leads from your inbox before they fall through the cracks. No backend to host, no new accounts to create, no subscription.

---

## What's inside

### Phase 1 — Follow-up Email Engine
Connect to Odoo, see every overdue activity assigned to you, and get AI-drafted follow-up emails ready to review in seconds. Edit, attach a file, schedule a follow-up date, assign a colleague — then open your mail client with one click. Every sent email is logged to the Odoo chatter automatically.

### Phase 2 — Lead Capture Engine
Point OEL at your Turbify / Yahoo Business inbox and it will scan for emails matching your saved templates (call alerts, quote requests, contact forms — whatever you receive). Groq AI reads the body and extracts the customer name, phone, email, and notes. Review the lead, confirm the assigned rep, pick an activity date, and push it to Odoo as an opportunity with one click. Duplicate checking runs automatically so you never pollute the CRM.

## Getting started

### What you need

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| Odoo instance | XML-RPC access required. API key from Profile → Account Security → API Keys |
| Groq API key | Free at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) — no credit card |
| Python 3 | Only needed for Local Server mode and Lead Capture |

### First run

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Double-click **`start.bat`** (Windows) or run **`python imap_server.py`** (Mac/Linux)
3. Open `index.html` in your browser (or use a local server — see below)
4. Enter your Odoo and Groq credentials on Step 1, click **Continue**

That's it. The local servers start silently in the background and handle both the CORS proxy and IMAP scanning.

### Hosting (optional)

The app works as a static site on any host:

```bash
# GitHub Pages — push to main, enable Pages in repo settings
# Netlify — drag the folder into the UI
# Vercel
vercel --prod
```

## The five-step workflow

```
Step 1  →  Step 2  →  Step 3  →  Step 4  →  Step 5
Creds      Connect     Draft      Send       Lead Capture
```

You can jump straight to **Step 5** (Lead Capture) from the credentials screen — no need to run the email drafting flow if you're only processing inbound leads.

## Phase 1 — Follow-up emails in detail

- Fetches all activities assigned to you that are due today or overdue
- Drafts a personalised email for each contact using Groq AI, pulling from the CRM record and recent chatter history
- **Review & edit** each draft before sending — subject, body, recipient
- Attach a file (it downloads alongside the mailto link so you can drag it in)
- **Assign activity to another user** with their own follow-up date
- **Skip / unskip** contacts from a batch
- On send: fires `mailto://`, logs the email to chatter as a note, marks the activity done, schedules the next follow-up

## Phase 2 — Lead capture in detail

### Setting up scan templates

The **Spec Wizard** is the fastest way to build a template:
1. Click **Wizard** in the Lead Specifications panel
2. Browse your recent inbox and check the emails you want to base templates on
3. Step through each — the body is shown exactly as the scanner will see it
4. Adjust the pre-filled subject/sender filters and add an AI hint if useful
5. **Save all & close**

Alternatively, create a spec manually and fill in the filters yourself.

### Scan filters

Each spec has two filter types (at least one required):

| Filter | Options | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Subject | contains, exact match | `"Call In"` matches `"Re: Call In Request"` |
| Sender | exact address, domain only, contains | `@searchkings.com` matches any alert from that domain |

Body search is also available but opt-in — it's slower since it downloads the full email.

### AI extraction

Groq reads the matched email body and extracts:
- **Customer name** (handles ALL CAPS call alert formats)
- **Phone** number
- **Email** address
- **Notes** — the full call summary or project description, verbatim
- **Agent** — the rep who took the call, used to auto-assign the Odoo opportunity

Add a hint to your spec to help Groq with unusual formats, e.g. *"This is a SearchKings call alert. Caller name is in ALL CAPS after the star rating line."*

### Pushing to Odoo

Before any push OEL checks `crm.lead` for matching email and phone. If a duplicate is found the push button is disabled and the existing records are shown — you can still override if you're sure it's a different opportunity. The check also runs at push time to catch concurrent entries by teammates.

On push:
1. Find or create `res.partner`
2. Create `crm.lead` as opportunity
3. Log the source email as a chatter note
4. Create a `mail.activity` due on your chosen date — it shows up in Phase 1 immediately

## Settings & data

### Export / Import

Use **Export settings** on the credentials screen to download a single JSON file containing everything:
- Odoo and Groq credentials
- IMAP credentials
- All lead specs
- Theme preference

Import on any machine to restore instantly. Specs are merged on import — existing ones are preserved.

### Themes

Five themes, switchable via the coloured dots in the top-right corner:

| | Theme | Accent |
|---|---|---|
| 🟡 | Lime (default) | `#c8f04e` |
| 🔵 | Cyan | `#00d8ff` |
| 🟠 | Ember | `#ff7c2a` |
| 🟣 | Light | `#6c47ff` |
| 🩷 | Violet | `#c77dff` |

## Local servers

Two Python servers run locally to handle things browsers can't do:

| Server | Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `server.py` | 7842 | CORS proxy for Odoo XML-RPC |
| `imap_server.py` | 7843 | IMAP scanning + starts server.py automatically |

**Start everything:** double-click `start.bat` (Windows) or run `python imap_server.py`.

Use **Check servers** in the app to verify both are running. The **Test Groq AI** button confirms your API key is working before you run a full scan.

### Without local servers

Switch to **CORS Proxy** mode on the credentials screen. The app falls back to public CORS proxies (corsproxy.io and others) — fine for Phase 1, but IMAP scanning requires the local server.

## Frequently asked questions

**Do I need to leave a terminal open?**
On Windows, `start.bat` launches both servers silently in the background — no terminal visible. On Mac/Linux, run `python imap_server.py` and minimise the window.

**Is my data safe?**
Everything runs locally. Credentials are stored in your browser's localStorage and optionally in an export file you control. Nothing is sent to any third-party service except Groq (for AI) and your own Odoo instance.

**What Groq model does it use?**
`llama-3.3-70b-versatile` by default — free tier, no credit card. Switch to `llama-3.1-8b-instant` for faster responses at higher volume.

**Can multiple people use it?**
Yes — each person runs their own copy and connects with their own Odoo credentials. Activities are always filtered to the logged-in user. Export your settings and share the JSON with a teammate to get them set up quickly (they'll need to add their own passwords).

**Can I install it as an app?**
Yes — open it in Chrome or Edge and look for the install icon in the address bar. It works as a standalone desktop or mobile app with offline support.
